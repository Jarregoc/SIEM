### Adding Threats
You can add threats to the database by entering in a date and url and then clicking the add button. Note you cannot add a threat to the database if the url is already in the database.

### Searching for Threats in Database
You can search for threats in the database by entering a url in the text box next to the Search button and then clicking the Search Button. If no data shows up this threat is not in the data base. If the threat is in the database the date the threat was entered and the threat url shows up under the text box:
